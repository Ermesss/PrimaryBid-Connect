# PrimaryBid Connect 
A web-based platform allowing brokers to access, submit and track offerings on behalf of your client.

I worked on this project for one year as main designer in the team and I felt the interest of recreate the mobile UI using Swift UI as a 
good practice and to see if I was able to move from design into code as well.

More informations about the platform can be found (<a href="https://primarybid.com/uk/distribution-partners">here</a>) and (<a href="https://www.ermannofissore.com/">here</a>)
